Here are five thoughtful questions that can help you gauge the students' efforts and understanding of the assignment. These questions focus on the key areas of the tutorial about decision trees, applying their own data, and overcoming challenges in coding:

---

### 1. **Understanding the Tutorial**  
- _How did you approach understanding the code in the tutorial? Were there any specific sections of the tutorial that were particularly challenging to follow? If so, how did you resolve those challenges?

``` text
TODO
```

### 2. **Adapting Code to Own Dataset**  
- _When modifying the tutorial code for your own dataset, what specific changes did you make? How did you ensure that the data you used was compatible with the model (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.)?_

``` text
TODO
```

### 3. **Overcoming Technical Challenges**  
- _What were the main technical challenges you encountered while executing the code on your machine (e.g., issues with libraries, errors in the code, dataset problems)? How did you troubleshoot and resolve them?_

``` text
TODO
```

### 4. **Evaluating Model Performance**  
- _After applying the Random Forest model to your own data, how did you evaluate the model's performance? What metrics did you use (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve), and why? Did the results align with your expectations?_

``` text
TODO
```

### 5. **Reflection and Insights**  
- _Looking back at the process, what did you learn from applying the Random Forest method to your own dataset? Are there any insights you gained about your dataset or the model that you didn't expect at the start of the project?_

``` text
TODO
```

These questions are designed to prompt reflection on both the technical process (e.g., understanding and modifying code, handling challenges) and the analytical process (e.g., evaluating model performance, drawing conclusions).

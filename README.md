# Activity 9

You Teach Me: Random Forests

## Assigned: Monday, 18th November 2024

## Due: Wednesday, 20th November 2024 __by the end of class__

---

## Learning Objectives

- Follow tutorials to learn core concepts.
- Teach yourself how to apply these concepts through coding.
- Present your findings, introducing others to your concepts and code.

## Instructions

You will edit three files to complete this activity: `src/tutorialCode.r`, `src/myCode.r`, and `writing/reflection.md`. Below are tutorials that explain and demonstrate Decision Trees and Random Forests. You will follow these tutorials, modify the code, and apply it to a new dataset.

### Code

#### `tutorialCode.r`

Follow the code in the tutorial exactly as presented. Your goal is to get it running on your machine by copying and pasting the code. After execution, the code should produce meaningful output, such as plots, tables, or other forms of analysis. Be sure to place this tutorial code into the `src/tutorialCode.r` file.

#### `myCode.r`

After you successfully run the tutorial code and produce meaningful results, modify the code for a similar analysis using a new dataset. This could involve loading a `.csv` file, or you could use a pre-existing dataset from an R package. Be sure to cite the dataset you use and include comments in your code to explain it, so the instructor can run it. Save your modified code in the `src/myCode.r` file.

### Writing

#### `reflection.md`

Once you have completed and tested your code (with proper citations and comments), move on to the reflection document. Write your reflections in the `writing/reflection.md` file.

### Lightning Talk During Lab Session

In lab we will be holding lightning talks for you to present your work. Please come prepared to next class to complete your work and to prepare your slides to be given during **lab time**.. Your presentation should be 3 to 5 minutes long and consist of 5 to 7 slides. The slides should cover the following points:

- **Overview**: Which tutorial did you use? How are Random Forests applied in the tutorial?
- **My Research**:
  - **Research Question**: What question are you addressing with your analysis?
  - **Data**: What dataset did you apply to this code?
  - **Method and Code**: What does your code do in the analysis?
  - **Results**: What results did you obtain?
  - **Conclusions**: What conclusions can you draw about your original question?

## Project Assessment

This assignment will be graded on a checkmark scale.

## GatorGrade Checking

You can use `gatorgrade` to check if you meet the baseline requirements for this assignment. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```
gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml
```

If `gatorgrade` confirms that all checks pass, you will know that your project meets the basic requirements.

Once you have pushed your work to your repository, visit the repository on GitHub (you may need to log in) to verify that your files have been successfully uploaded.

### Installing GatorGrade

1. First, [install `pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/).
2. Then, install `gatorgrade` by running the following command:

```
pipx install gatorgrade
```

Additionally, you may want to install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) (or another text editor) to assist with editing your code files.

## Seeking Assistance

If you have questions about the project outside of class or lab time, please feel free to ask them in the course's Discord channel or during the instructorâ€™s or teaching assistant's office hours.
